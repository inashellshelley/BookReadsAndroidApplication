2.         Modules or Activity Explanation & Screenshots
 i) MainActivity: Serving as the app's gateway, MainActivity presents users with a curated list of books fetched from a predefined dataset. Leveraging RecyclerView, this activity efficiently displays each book item, including its title, author, genre, and read status. The Adapter class facilitates the binding of book data to RecyclerView's ViewHolder objects, ensuring smooth scrolling and dynamic updates.
ii) Adapter: As the intermediary between MainActivity and the RecyclerView, Adapter handles the creation of ViewHolder instances and manages the logic for populating them with book data. By inflating the layout for each item, setting up click listeners, and dynamically loading book cover images based on their titles, Adapter streamlines the presentation of book information to users.
iii) BookDetailActivity: This activity offers users a deeper dive into the selected book's details. Upon receiving the book data and associated image resource ID via Intent from MainActivity, BookDetailActivity presents a comprehensive view comprising the book's title, author, genre, summary, and cover image. Users can also choose to add the book to their reading list, triggering an action to update the app's state accordingly.
iv) FinalActivity: Following a successful addition to the reading list, FinalActivity serves as a confirmation screen, acknowledging the user's action and providing options to either return to the main screen or continue exploring the application's offerings. Its minimalist design and clear messaging ensure a positive user experience post-interaction.
V) setData: This utility object encapsulates the logic for generating dummy book data via the SetBooks() function. By returning a list of BookData objects preloaded with titles, authors, genres, summaries, and associated image resources, setData facilitates seamless integration of sample content into the application's flow.
vi) SplashScreenActivity: Acting as the app's introduction, SplashScreenActivity displays a captivating splash screen upon launch, effectively setting the tone for the user's interaction with the application. Its brief delay before transitioning to MainActivity adds a polished touch to the overall user experience.
5.    Conclusion & Future Scope
